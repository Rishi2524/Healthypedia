                <p>"After trying and failing to adopt a meditation practice for years, I had all but given up hope. I knew it would help me think more clearly, be less reactive, and be a better version of myself. But I just couldn't seem to stick with it. Then I found Vedic Meditation. It was the first practice that really ‘stuck’ with me. In spite of its relative simplicity, part of the difference maker was getting proper training. Five consistent years later, and I'm calmer, I sleep better, I think more clearly, and overall my life just feels easier. I honestly can't imagine how I would handle the ups and downs of entrepreneurship without it."

                <p>“I eased into Vedic Meditation about a year ago with a small group led by Kyle Young. It has helped me more successfully navigate daily stressors of modern life while attempting to balance personal and professional responsibilities. During a recent hospital stay, meditation even allowed me to identify the source of an adverse reaction. This daily ‘come as you are’ practice of meditation has benefitted me precisely because of its ease of use. It works for me because it can be done almost anywhere, and I take it with me wherever I go.”

I am grateful for the profound discoveries meditation has allowed me to experience – mentally, emotionally, and physically – and for Kyle's continued guidance and support throughout this journey.”
